**OIPSIP INTERNSHIP**

This internship focuses on data science and analytics, providing valuable hands-on experience with various tasks.

**TASK-1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**

In this task,  predicted the species of IRIS Flower using attributes such as petal length, sepal length, petal width, and sepal width. The classification is done using Decision Tree classification (ID3 Classifier).

**TASK-2: UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS**

Explored datasets related to unemployment by creating various charts and graphs using the matplotlib and seaborn libraries in Python.

**TASK-3: CAR PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING**

This task involves predicting the price of a car based on factors such as brand reputation, car features, mileage, and more. Car price prediction is a significant research area in machine learning, and interns will gain practical experience in training prediction models.

**TASK-4: EMAIL SPAM DETECTION**

Builded an email spam detection tool using Python. By training machine learning models, they classify emails into spam and non-spam categories, helping users identify and avoid potentially harmful content.

**TASK-5: SALES PREDICTION**

In this task, predict future sales of products using machine learning techniques. By analyzing factors such as advertising expenditure, target demographics, and advertising platforms, interns develop sales forecasting models using linear regression.
